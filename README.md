Notepad: A Backbone Reference Application

NOTE: This code is currently in an experimental state. I don't recommend using it as guidance for how to build Backbone apps at the moment. If you would like to see a better reference code base, check out the version of [Todomvc](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc)

## Feature Overview

- Has a simple API consisting of ONE route and ONE controller to manage notes.
- Has view templates that look just like TodoMVC example
- Users can save, edit and delete notes.
